      Logical operators: Logical operators in javascript, unlike operators in
      other programming languages, do not return true or false. They always
      return one of the operands. AND ( && ) operator - If both the values are
      truthy, always the second value is returned. If the first value is falsy
      then the first value is returned or if the second value is falsy then the
      second value is returned.
      <ul>
        <li>
          OR ( | | ) operator - If the first value is truthy, then the first
          value is returned. Otherwise, always the second value gets returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          AND ( && ) operator - If both the values are truthy, always the second
          value is returned. If the first value is falsy then the first value is
          returned or if the second value is falsy then the second value is
          returned.
