    <h2>Constructor</h2>
    <h3>
      A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is
      typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called
      when you declare an object using the new keyword.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if
      there are any object properties present.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      In JavaScript, here’s what happens when a constructor is invoked:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>A new empty object is created</li>

        <li>
          this keyword starts referring to that newly created object and hence
          it becomes the current instance object
        </li>

        <li>
          The newly created object is then returned as the constructor’s
          returned value
        </li>
      </ul>
